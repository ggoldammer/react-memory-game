#Clicky Game(PseudoCode)

This will be a React app that will display an array of 12 images. Each image will be generated by a component. Each component will contain image elements. An on-click function event listener will run that will listen to a clicked image component. When an image is clicked, the state will change to "clicked". If something is clicked when the state is already "clicked", the user will lose. As long as each image hasn't been clicked, it has the potential to add +1 to the user's score. The max amount of points one can gain is 12.
